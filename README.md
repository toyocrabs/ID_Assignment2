ID Assignment 2

Introduction:
This website called RADAR is meant to help users who would like to find facilities/places that are near a location, hence the name. This is done mainly through the use of Google Maps API, Geocoding API and Places API. 

Features:
RADAR only has one main feature which is to search for nearby places/facilities based on user input. To start, there is an input box which requires users to enter a location. The input box also has autocomplete so that most of the time, user will not have a need to type out the full address and can just select from the list of recommended entries/locations google autocomplete suggested. Next up, is a option box that contains a total of 5 types of places users can choose from, Cafes, Parking, Shopping Malls, ATM, and Toilets. The user will have to pick the type of places that will be shown on the map on the bottom of the website. The last input box requires users to enter a number which will be used as the radius (in meters). Only places within the radius will be shown on the map. Lastly, there is a Google Maps on the bottom of the website to show user's their location and where the nearby facilities/places are located. Some features that I wish to add in the future is the ability to click on any of that markers, and there would be a route from the 'home location' to the marker displayed on the screen. Another feature is the ability to show information about the nearby places found and the ability to filter/sort/rank them in order by distance, price, etc.
